# *** Spoiler Alert *** #

My solution to the crime and a demonstration of how to showcase SQL projects by querying a SQLite database in the browser.

Edit mySQL.sql to display your own SQL. The SQL file has been edited using the vscode extension SQL Notebook

Alternative editors with different delimiters & markdown indicator blocks will not work unless loadSQL.js is altered to accommodate.
